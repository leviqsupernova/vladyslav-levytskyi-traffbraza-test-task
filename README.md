While the testing was carried out based on the scarce instructions provided, especially for the browser app wrappers, in a real-world scenario, multiple clarifications would be inquired prior to starting tests.  

The templates and granularity were adjusted to fit he context - simple exploratory test reports without formal steps to reproduce, actual, and expected results.   

The websites tests were too extensive for a more granular test table, so a summary was chosen to outline the actions performed.  

The focus was on functionality from the end-user perspective, yet multiple observations for other types of issues (performance, compatibility, UI/UX, business perspective) were also reported.
